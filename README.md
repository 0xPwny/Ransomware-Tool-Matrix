# Ransomware Tool Matrix
- This repository contains a list of which tools each ransomware gang or extortionist gang uses
- As defenders, we should exploit the fact that many of the tools used by these cybercriminals are often reused
- We can threat hunt, deploy detections, and block these tools to eliminate the ability of adversaries to launch intrusions 

> [!TIP]
>  This list has several use cases, which are as follows:
> - As a list of leads for threat hunting inside the environments available to you
> - As a list of leads to look for during incident response engagements
> - As a checklist of tools to identify patterns of behaviour between certain ransomware affiliates
